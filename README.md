# the something mod
the most random balatro mod i could possibly think of

so far includes 27 jokers (13 of those break the game entirely and 14 of those are somewhat on the balanced side (kind of)), one seal, 3 tarots, 5 spectrals, and 4 booster packs

requires [talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman/) to function properly
